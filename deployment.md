**Frontend and Backend Deployment**
1. Create feature branches for any new development work on the frontend and backend repositories.
2. Write automated tests to ensure new functionality and bug fixes work as expected.
3. Merge approved feature branches into the main development branch.
4. Run a full suite of integration tests on the development environment.
5. Deploy the updated frontend and backend code to the staging environment for manual testing.
6. Once testing is complete, create production deployment packages and deploy to the production environment.
7. Monitor production for any issues and roll back if necessary.

**Static Asset Management on S3 and CloudFront Configuration**
1. Store all static assets (images, CSS, JS, etc.) in an S3 bucket.
2. Configure CloudFront to use the S3 bucket as the origin, enabling CloudFront to cache and serve the static assets.
3. Set appropriate cache control headers on the S3 objects to control caching behavior.
4. Configure CloudFront to use HTTPS connections and enforce redirects from HTTP to HTTPS.
5. Set up CloudFront logging to monitor usage and diagnose any issues.
6. Configure CloudFront to use a custom domain (e.g. static.flattts.com) for the static asset distribution.

**CloudFront Invalidation**
1. When updating static assets, upload the new versions to S3 with unique file names (e.g. using a hash or version number in the filename).
2. Create a CloudFront invalidation for the updated assets. This will instruct CloudFront to refresh the cached content and serve the latest version.
3. The performance benefit of this approach is that users will immediately see the updated content without having to wait for the CloudFront cache to expire. CloudFront will also continue to serve the cached assets for subsequent requests, improving overall site performance.
