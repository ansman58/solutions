### My Aproach to this would be:

### File Structure using NextJS
---

- **app/**
  - **properties/**
    - `page.tsx`
    - `[id]/`
      - `page.tsx`
- **components/**
  - **properties/**
    - `PropertyDetails.tsx`
    - `..`
- **store/**
  - `propertyDetails.tsx`

  ---

- Create a `pages/property/[id]` page that will serve as the parent component. This page will fetch the property details data from the server.

- Define an `IPropertyDetail` interface to type the property data.

   ```javacript
     Interface IPropertyDetail {
      location: string;
      Name: string;
      Price: number;
      landlordInfo: ILandlordInfo;
  }
   ```

- Pass the fetched data down to the `<PropertyDetails>` component as a prop.
    ```javascript
      <PropertyDetails data={data}>
    ```
    `This approach avoids the need for a state management library like Redux since the props can be passed down to the children directly without a lot of prop drilling`

### High Resolution Image Optimization
---
- Use Next.js's built-in `<Image>` component to optimize the high-resolution images

- Set the `priority` prop on important images to ensure they load first.

- Alternativey, Implement lazy loading with a blurred placeholder using a library like `react-lazy-load-image-component`.

- Leverage the CDN caching of the hosting provider or services like Cloudflare to improve performance.


### Using Redux,
---
- Create a Redux store to manage the global state of properties data.

- Define the following Redux actions: 
    - fetchPropertyDetails: Fetches the details for a specific property.
    - setPropertyDetails: Updates the store with the fetched property details.

- Create a reducer function to handle the property details state:
  
     - The initial state will be an object to hold the current property details.
     -  The fetchPropertyDetails action should trigger an API call and dispatch the setPropertyDetails action with the response data.
     -  The setPropertyDetails action should update the property details state.
